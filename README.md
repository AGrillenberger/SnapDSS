# Snap!DSS

Snap!DSS is an extension for the block-based programming language [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu) which was developed by Andreas Grillenberger ([University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, Computing Education Research Group](https://ddi.cs.fau.de)) for allowing students to conduct simple data stream analysis in secondary schools. Snap!DSS can be loaded in every fork of Snap! by importing `SnapDSS.xml`, however the provided exemplary project was designed for the Snap! fork [Snap4Arduino](http://www.snap4arduino.rocks).

## Conference Paper
Details on Snap!DSS can be found in a conference paper by Andreas Grillenberger & Ralf Romeike, published at [ISSEP 2017](http://issep2017.cs.helsinki.fi). An authors' draft of the paper is available at [ComputingEducation.de](http://computingeducation.de/pub/2017_Grillenberger-Romeike_ISSEP2017.pdf).
